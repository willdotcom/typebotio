# Configuration

:::note
The easiest way to get started with Typebot is with [the official managed service in the Cloud](https://app.typebot.io). It takes 1 minute to try out the tool for free. You'll have high availability, backups, security, and maintenance all managed for you by me, Baptiste, Typebot's founder.

That's also the best way to support my work, open-source software, and you'll get great service!
:::

When running Typebot on your machine, the following configuration parameters can be supplied as environment variables.

Typebot is composed of 2 main applications:

- The builder, where you build your typebots
- The viewer, where your user answer the typebot

Both apps have their environment to configure properly:

- [Builder configuration](/self-hosting/configuration/builder)
- [Viewer configuration](/self-hosting/configuration/viewer)
