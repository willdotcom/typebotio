# Getting started

:::note
The easiest way to get started with Typebot is with [the official managed service in the Cloud](https://app.typebot.io). It takes 1 minute to try out the tool for free. You'll have high availability, backups, security, and maintenance all managed for you by me, Baptiste, Typebot's founder.

That's also the best way to support my work, open-source software, and you'll get great service!

Typebot is composed of 2 Next.js applications you need to deploy:

- the builder, where you build your typebots
- the viewer, where your user answer the typebot

I've written guides on how to deploy Typebot using:

- [Docker](/self-hosting/docker)
- [Vercel](/self-hosting/vercel)
