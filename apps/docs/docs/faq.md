# FAQ

## How do I move my typebots from the old version to the new version?

Because Typebot is built on a new infrastructure that allows maximum freedom and performance, you won't be able to migrate your typebots from v1 to v2.
Rest assured, 1.0 bots will still be available.

The best strategy is to keep your v1 bots in v1 and create your new bots on v2 😃

## I can't see my previously created bots! 😱

It's because they now reside in v1 located at https://old.typebot.io.

## What's the difference between v1 and v2?

Typebot 2.0 is a brand new building experience that allows you to create unique personalized experience without having to scratch your head 😄

It is also built a more powerful and scalable infrastructure that unlocks many possible future features

## I have a lifetime or pro plan on v1 but I don't have it on v2.

Try to click again on the “Create my account” button on the email I sent you (with subject "Unlock your Typebot 2.0 plan"). It should unlock your plan.

Otherwise, shoot an email to support@typebot.io with the email associated to your v1 account.

## Is human takeover is available on Typebot?

No, Typebot is specifically built for async chats. I believe Live Chat is a whole other product.

You can still implement great customer support with Typebot by using a ticketing system such as [Freshdesk](https://freshdesk.com/) or [Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com/). You can create a ticket each time your user answers the bot.
