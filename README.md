## Getting started with Typebot

The easiest way to get started with Typebot is with [the official managed service in the Cloud](https://app.typebot.io).

It takes 1 minute to try out the builder for free. You'll have high availability, backups, security, and maintenance all managed for you by me, Baptiste, Typebot's founder.

That's also the best way to support my work, open-source software, and you'll get great service!
